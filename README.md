1. Project overview
The Animatronic Time Management Assistant is a mechatronic device that combines animatronics, computer vision, voice interaction, and scheduling tools into an interactive desktop companion. It supports daily time-management tasks through physical movement, face tracking, and a graphical display interface. This project is developed as part of my Engineering Thesis (Bachelor’s Degree Project) at Poznan University of Technology, under the supervision of dr hab. inż. Dominik Rybarczyk.

2. Features
- Graphical schedule display – calendar, reminders, daily agenda shown on a 7” QLED 1024×600 screen
- Voice-controlled calendar management using a microphone and onboard audio system
- Real-time face tracking with a 5 MP USB autofocus camera
- Animatronic movement driven by 6× SG90 micro servos and 1× LF-20MG servo
- Automatic orientation toward the user based on camera tracking
- Compact size: 20 × 20 × 20 cm

3. Hardware
- Raspberry Pi 4 Model B
- SG90 micro servos ×6
- LF-20MG servo ×1
- USB 5MP 75° autofocus camera
- 7” QLED display (1024×600)
- Speaker + microphone
- Custom mechanical structure

4. Software
- Servo control and motion system
- Face recognition & tracking algorithms
- Voice command handling
- Graphical User Interface (GUI) for calendar and reminders
- System integration for animatronic behavior

5. Project Scope
- Literature review and analysis of existing animatronic solutions
- Mechanical design of the structure
- Development of the control software
- Implementation of face-tracking and movement control
- GUI development
- Prototype assembly and commissioning
- Functional testing and performance analysis
- Final conclusions and potential development directions

7. Purpose

The project explores how intelligent human-machine interaction and animatronic design can enhance productivity tools. By combining robotics with time-management features, the assistant creates a more engaging and interactive way to plan and manage daily tasks.
