This thesis presents the process of designing, manufacturing, and programming an animatronic
time-management assistant named CAL-BOT. The primary objective of the project was to develop
a robot that supports effective time organization while incorporating features that enhance the
naturalness of interaction and the sense of user immersion. The mechanical structure was designed
using AutoDesk Fusion 360 and subsequently fabricated with 3D printing technology. The robot’s
software, implemented in Python, is based on the cooperation of two main modules responsible
for mechanical control and assistant functionality. CAL-BOT utilizes the Gemini 2.0 Flash langu-
age model for natural language processing, enabling fluent conversation and intelligent schedule
management through voice commands.
